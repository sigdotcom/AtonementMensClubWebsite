Our purpose is to strengthen the bonds of brotherhood among the men of Atonement. 
Through this fellowship, we are empowered to serve the Lord by actively supporting
our church and community. A key part of our mission is to raise essential funds
for those important projects and needs that fall outside the regular budget, 
ensuring our school, church, and community have the resources to thrive.
